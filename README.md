# Pocket to Evernote

Pocket to Evernote is a tool to help with migrating from using [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) to [Evernote](https://evernote.com).

## Development

The tool is built with [Next.js](nextjs.org/).

### Installing Dependencies

The project uses [Node](https://nodejs.org) v12 and supporting versions of NPM. If you need to install Node, I recommend [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
To install dependencies run the command below.

```bash
npm install
```
